## Introduction
It is widely acknowledged that capturing non-local information among input images is crucial for effective image restoration (IR). 
However, fully incorporating such global cues into transformer-based methods can be computationally expensive, particularly when dealing with large input images or patches. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that the attention mechanism within the transformer considers numerous unnecessary cues from unrelated objects or regions. In response to these challenges, we introduce the K-Graph Transformer (KGT) for IR in this paper. Specifically, KGT treats image features within a given window as the nodes of a graph. 
Instead of establishing connections among all the nodes, the proposed K-Graph Constructor creates a sparse yet representative K-Graph that connects only the essential nodes flexibly. 
Then the K-Graph Attention Block is proposed within each KGT layer to conduct the self-attention operation only among these selected nodes with linear computational complexity.
Extensive experimental results validate that the proposed KGT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.
